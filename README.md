PhpZone is a generic tool for the easy creation of [YAML] configured console applications. Its primary purpose is to
provide a centralized automation tool for developers to simplify development workflow.

As it's built on [Symfony components] without rapid custom modifications,
it can be used as an application skeleton for any individual commands.

**Its power is based on simplicity of centralized configuration via [YAML] and main value comes from extensions.**

## Basic Usage

An example speaks a hundred words so letâ€™s go through one.

Create a `phpzone.yml` file in the root of a project:

```yaml
extensions:
    PhpZone\Shell\Shell: # register an extension with a configuration
        tests:
            - vendor/bin/behat
            - vendor/bin/phpunit
            - vendor/bin/phpspec
```

and run:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phpzone tests
```

As you would expect, the configuration contains the definition for the command `tests` and when you run it, all
defined sub-commands will be executed.

The `PhpZone\Shell\Shell` extension is not a part of the `phpzone/phpzone` package, but an aside project
based on PhpZone. More info [PhpZone Shell].
