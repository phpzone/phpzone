PhpZone Docker
--------------

A Docker command builder configured by `YAML`_. Its primary purpose is to
provide a simple way to define commands for running Docker containers/instances which could be used in daily workflow
of every developer. Since now not all developers need to have a knowledge about Docker but still everyone can simply
understand what is running. It is not only about the knowledge but also experienced developers can find an advantage
in keeping ready-made commands.
